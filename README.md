# The Tech Academy Basic C# Projects

This repository contains my work from the **C# and .NET Framework â€“ Parts 1 & 2** courses at *The Tech Academy*. Through a combination of structured lessons and hands-on assignments, I learned the fundamentals of C# programming and backend development using .NET technologies.

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

Throughout the course, I gained both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical experience** in:

- âœ… Core C# programming (syntax, data types, logic, loops, methods)
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism)
- âœ… Exception handling, debugging, and code refactoring
- âœ… Using arrays, lists, structs, enums, generics, and lambda expressions
- âœ… Building interactive **console apps**
- âœ… Understanding and applying **MVC architecture**
- âœ… Developing **ASP.NET MVC web apps**
- âœ… Connecting applications to databases via **Entity Framework**
- âœ… Creating real-world projects such as:
  - A **shipping quote console app**
  - A **Blackjack game**
  - A **car insurance web app** with quote calculation logic and admin panel
  - A **Code-First Entity Framework app** for managing students
  - A **personal portfolio website** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- C#, .NET Framework, ASP.NET MVC  
- Entity Framework (Database First and Code First)  
- Razor syntax  
- SQL Server, LINQ  
- Visual Studio, Git, GitHub  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

## ðŸ§ª Projects in This Repository

This repository includes:
- Assignments and exercises from each module  
- Mini-projects built during the course  
- Final assignments and challenges demonstrating application of full-stack .NET knowledge  

## ðŸ“‚ Notes

All projects are organized by topic and are part of one local repository. A zipped folder with database `.mdf` and `.ldf` files is included where required.
